Welcome to the home of STAC and Rust.
We're happy you're here.

## What is rustac?

**rustac** is a [Github repository](https://github.com/stac-utils/rustac) that holds the code for several Rust [crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html) that can be used to create, search for, and otherwise work with [STAC](https://stacspec.org).

!!! note

    Until 2025-04-17, this repository was named **stac-rs**.
    See [this RFC](https://github.com/stac-utils/rustac/issues/641) for context on the name change.

## What is rustac-py?

**rustac-py** is a Python [package](https://pypi.org/project/rustac/) that provides a simple API for interacting with STAC.
**rustac-py** uses the Rust code in **rustac** under the hood.

```python
import rustac

items = rustac.search("s3://bucket/items.parquet", ...)
```

Check out the [rustac-py docs](https://stac-utils.github.io/rustac-py) for more.

## Why are rustac and rustac-py in two separate repos?

Couple of reasons:

1. **rustac** is intended to be useful on its own.
   It's not just the engine for some Python bindings.
2. Care-and-feeding for Python wheels built from Rust is a bit finicky.
   By moving **rustac-py** to its own repo, we're able to separate the concerns of keeping a good, clean Rust core, and building Python wheels.
   Not everyone agrees with this strategy, but here we are.
